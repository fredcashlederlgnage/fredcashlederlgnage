There are a wide variety of alternatives you should look into before taking out a payday loan. These alternatives are applicable to all borrowers, including those with less-than-stellar credit or those who need to reduce their overall monthly loan costs.
Get help from nonprofits and charities

Some not-for-profit and charity organizations offer financial assistance to those in need. Beyond money, these organizations might also offer resources to help you get back on your feet, such as job training, educational workshops and mentorship.

Financial help from a nonprofit is essentially a no-strings-attached gift that you don’t have to pay back. And because it’s free money, competition for it can be steep. You’ll need to show that you qualify, and it may take some time for any money or assistance to arrive.
