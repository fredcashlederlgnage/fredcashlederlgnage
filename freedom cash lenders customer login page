Sometimes all it takes to lower your medical bills is a phone call to the medical facility or hospital. Explain that you’re in a financial bind and unable to pay off your medical bills. They might be able to work with you and come up with a payment plan without interest.

If you were denied a payment plan or are nervous about reaching out directly, consider working with a medical billing advocate. These professionals can look over your medical bills and explanations of benefits as well as check your bills for errors. They typically charge a percentage of the amount they saved you on your bills, although some nonprofits offer this type of advocacy free of charge.

Another way to reduce medical bills is to get a medical credit card. You will only be able to use a medical credit card to pay for health-related expenses. Interest is usually deferred, but you will eventually still have to pay it.

Who it’s best for: Those who have a substantial amount of medical debt.
When the money arrives: It varies. The review process could take up to 30 days from the date you originally filed the claim dispute. If you’re waiting to hear back on relief options, stay on top of your minimum payments.
