Personal loans can have several advantages. For one, they’re quite versatile in what you can use the money for, including buying groceries or paying bills if you’re in a financial pinch. Another draw of personal loans is that most are unsecured, so you won’t have to offer collateral such as a house or car.

You can find personal loans through banks, online lenders or credit unions, which may offer lower rates of repayment benefits for existing members.

If you’ve made missteps with your credit or have a short credit history, bad credit personal loans are available. The credit requirements are often lower  and more flexible, which does increase your chances of getting approved.
